          <h4>Chapter 3 - Mindfulness Without Butt on Cushion</h4>
          <h5>Just to clarify...</h5>
            <p>I accidentally read through chapter 2 and 3 at the same time in the last blog. I have reflected well on both chapters, but these questions
            are better directed towards the content of chapter 3, so we will stick with that. Just to be clear, I have read both chapters. :) </p>

              <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
                I think that mindfulness conversation as a technique makes sense to me, and all of the practices the author encourages have really 
                great outcomes. I don't have anyone in my life who was willing to do the mindful
                conversation technique with me, so I did it with myself. I sounded like a crazy person for about 10 minutes, going back and forth
                between myself and my own thoughts, but in a way it was cathartic. In the end I ended up confirming most of my own thoughts.
                I guess if it was to occur between myself and another person, it would be very different outcome-wise.

              <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
              Walking meditation, guided meditation and breathing meditation. I have tried all three with similar outcomes.

              <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                I'm getting a cat, and I'm stoked about it. Been waiting for this particular cat breed to come to Wellington. Devon Rex's are
                very attention-seeking and also very playful. It won't actually be born until I graduate. I am already thinking about how I
                can use the cat as a mindful centre for meditation, or if a young and playful cat would actually be a good centre to meditate on.
