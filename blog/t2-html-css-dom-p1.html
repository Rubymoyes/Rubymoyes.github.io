     <div class="question 1">
         <ol>
         <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?<br>
        I would describe HTML, CSS and the DOM as the structure or foundation of a home, the CSS as the paint on the walls, and the DOM as the blueprint of the home to be referred back to as you make changes to the paint and the structure.</li>
        </li></ol>

    <div class="question 2">
        <ol>
        <li>What is meant by boxifying design?<br>
        Boxifying is the term used to determine each and every possible box around each element on a page. For example, to boxify a simple website, you would box out each larger space into obvious grids, and then work down each box to make the grid more defined. Usually when you boxify, you will be determining each and every possible way you could seperate and identify each box inside the grid you create.</li>
        </li></ol>
    </div>
    <div class="question 3">
        <ol><li>What is the box model?<br>
        The box model is the model used for determining the space between the content, the padding, the border and the margin. Specifying these items creates the layout on your page for this content.
