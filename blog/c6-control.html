          <h3>Control - Controlling Emotional Response</h3>

          <li>
            When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?<br>
            I hate the word trigger, it's definitely been abused by SJW-inspired assholes who have coined the word trigger to mean a word or phrase that they hear and become disproportionately offended or defensive. They could do with a reading of this book, I think. I cringe eternally whenever I hear it, even in different contexts.<br>
            For me, the one thing that 'triggers' me is when I have been working for what feels like a long time, and then I look to the timer and I see that only 60 minutes or 90 minutes has passed. That makes me a little bit discouraged and makes the work seem a lot less fun.<br>
          </li>

          <li>How did you find the SiBerian North RailRoad exercise?<br>
            The SiBerian North RailRoad exercise is something that I actually knew existed before reading the book, just under a different name. I remember researching this in my teenage years because I would find myself constantly in situations where I would need to remain calm with strong thoughts, and so I looked up ways to help with that. I found something very similar and practiced that for a long time.<br>
