          <h3>Chapter 7 - Empathy and the Monkey Business of Brain Tangos</h3>

          <p>
            <ul>
             <li>
                Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?<br><br>
                I'm not exactly able to practice a lot of these exercises with other people, but I can certainly see how they would be effective. I'll run over them 
                by myself at home while reading the chapters. This one makes a lot of sense, and is very pragmatic in terms of just exerting a basic and essential human behaviour, which is 
                empathy.
             </li>
             <li>
                Try empathic listening - how did it go?<br><br>
                Went well, as well as a conversation with yourself can go!
                
             </li>
             <li>
                How did you find the loving kindness meditation?<br><br>
                It was very relaxing and comforting, and it was an effective meditation.
             </li>
             <li>
                Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.<br><br>
                I wasn't able to find someone to participate in this exercise with me.
             </li>
             <li>
                Any other musings?<br><br>
                None.
             </li>
