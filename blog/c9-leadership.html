                        What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?<br><br>
                        I definitely agree that good leaders are ones that are able to develop good relationships with the people they're leading, and I have had great experiences with managers 
                        who have actually made an effort to talk to me and get to know me as a person. I have also had some absolutely horrible managers, ones that have been petty and angry 
                        and bitter, and also managers who have cut off all communication with the people who work under them. That's not a good way to lead anyone. I agree with the fact that 
                        things need to be talked out, but there are just some people who are unwilling to change their attitude.

                        Do the multiplying goodness meditation and the Tonglen meditation. How did you find them?<br><br>
                        I found both the mediations pretty good and helpful. I think that I struggle with guided meditations, and do better when I am in a mindset that is prepared 
                        to wind down and focus. Right now, I definitely am not in that mindset and getting into that zone is almost impossible naturally.

                        How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?<br><br>
                        I would say that some of it applies, but I don't feel the exact same way as the book describes the different attributes of SCARF. I think that some of it definitely applies, but not all of it 
                        I will adapt for my own usage.

                        Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)<br><br>
                        I have these types of conversations all the time with my partner. We're both going through a really stressful time, work and life otherwise, and we're 
                        just trying to work through these things together.

                        Nothing else today.
