    <h1>A Journey through Phase 0</h1>
    <p>
            Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>
            At the time during this assignment, I did not have the resources to try all forms of timeboxing and time management. I set my self a task (timebox an hour for the assignment resources, finish the second blog post) and gave myself an hour and 45 minutes to do this. I knew it would be enough, but I gave myself an amount of time that I knew would allow me to relax into the task and make me feel like I had more time to concentrate on the task more instead of looking at the clock. I think that something similar to the pomodoro technique would work, but for now I used a simple time limit. As a behavioural reward for doing the task with no distractions (despite there being plenty of distractions around me) I will allow myself to watch the first couple of minutes of a podcast I enjoy after this is done.
            <br><br>
            What did you find interesting? <br>
            I found it interesting that there was actually study behind the fact that rewarding yourself in small ways for behavioural changes will in fact help good habits form. Eventually I will use this technique for other things in my life that could use some habitual guidance.
            <br><br>
            What worked for you?<br>
            The time setting and reward system I think gives incentive as well as a set time frame, which for me gives certainty.
            <br><br>
            Which will you experiment further with?<br>
            I will be experimenting with hopefully all of the provided techniques. The first ones I will be trying are the pomodoro technique, and the behaviour to habit reward system.
