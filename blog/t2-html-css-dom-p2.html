                <li><h2>What is grid-based design?</h2>
                Grid based design is when you divide your page into grids and rows, and then depending on where the elements sit on the page, you can carefully adjust where each part goes depending on which grid or row you have identified it to be in.</li>
                <li><h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
                Responsive web pages (CSS resetting and responsive design) are done through using HTML to define what browers the page will work on, as well as what happens to the page on certain screen resolutions. For example, the site you have made might show a layout to a larger screen - say, on a computer monitor - but might take out some unnecessary text or images for a smaller resolution screen on a device, like a tablet or a phone.</li>
                <li><h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
                    Semantic structure is the structure in CSS which establishes a tidy and easy-to-identify sequences of code. Google says that Semantic structure is a fancy term for an organization that represents meaning. However, I think that semantic structure is something that <em>just makes the most sense</em>. If you're reading code that someone's written and you're wanting to find what they've done that makes something cool happen on their page, then you want to be able to look at their CSS and not be absolutely swamped with mess. If you want to make sense of your own code, then a good tidy semantic structure is pretty much necessary. It's like writing notes in a lecture - if you don't have the right bookmarks and headers and if everything is mislabelled and spread out all over the place, it's not going to be a pleasant time trawling through it all and trying to find what's gone wrong.</li>
                <li><h2>What are some other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h2>
                I found the grid and row thing quite confusing at first - as I'm sure most do when they start out - and I definitely remained confused for a long time. I just wasn't moving through the material at a pace I wanted, and I wasn't retaining the information that I needed to. But when I actually put the grid into practice on this website and blog pages, I found it a lot more understandable. I guess I am also reflecting on my own preferred way of learning, which I knew was always more practicality and learn-by-doing based. I didn't realise to what extent on how much my learning was centred on those systems.</li>
