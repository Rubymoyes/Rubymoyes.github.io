             <li><h2>What is grid-based design?</h2>
             Grid based design is when you divide your page into grids and rows, and then depending on where the elements sit on the page, you can carefully adjust where each part goes depending on which grid or row you have identified it to be in.</li>
             <li><h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
             Responsive web pages (CSS resetting and responsive design) are done through using HTML to define what browers the page will work on, as well as what happens to the page on certain screen resolutions. For example, the site you have made might show a layout to a larger screen - say, on a computer monitor - but might take out some unnecessary text or images for a smaller resolution screen on a device, like a tablet or a phone.</li>
             <li><h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
             Semantic structure is about the way the HTML is laid out which will make sense to the browser as well as anyone reading it. For example, some recognisable tags are the header tags (< h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 > and < h4>) and also image tags to recognise an image and it's location (< img >).</li>
             <li><h2>What are some other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h2>
             I found the grid and row thing quite confusing at first - as I'm sure most do when they start out - and I definitely remained confused for a long time. I just wasn't moving through the material at a pace I wanted, and I wasn't retaining the information that I needed to. But when I actually put the grid into practice on this website and blog pages, I found it a lot more understandable. I guess I am also reflecting on my own preferred way of learning, which I knew was always more practicality and learn-by-doing based. I didn't realise to what extent on how much my learning was centred on those systems.</li>
