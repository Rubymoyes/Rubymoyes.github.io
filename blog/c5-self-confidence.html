          <h3>Chapter Four - All-Natural, Organic Self-Confidence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
              The relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness is that they are essentially the same thing.
              There were two quotes in the middle of the chapter that defined the two terms, but basically were
              describing the same thing. In this way, the author was able to discover that they are both trainable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). 
              What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
              Body scanning was a very similar feeling to guided meditation, and sometimes I do prefer those sorts of meditation.
              Most of the time when I am hyperfocused on events or thoughts, I find that journaling is a much easier practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
              I find that way of thinking about emotions are very useful, especially in situations when you cannot let
              your emotions get the better of you. I usually appear very composed and engaged in stressful or emotional situations
              just by trying to stay aware of my body and aware of myself, which seems to work for me. For example, now if I become
              overwhelmed with emotion in public or in a place I am sharing with others, I will tend to hold those in until I get
               home or until I am fully alone. I've done that for a really long time, since I am also very embarassed 
               by the face that I make when I am crying. It's not that bad. I do remember my dad telling me I was an ugly crier.
               Even when I am alone, sometimes I allow those strong emotions to overtake me. <br>
               From this section, I really liked this quote. <em>Thoughts and emotions are like 
                clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena 
                in the sky that come and go. Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in 
                mind and body that come and go. Possessing this insight, one creates the possibility of change within oneself.</em><br>
