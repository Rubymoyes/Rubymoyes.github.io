                How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?<br>
                I've never found something that I love that eventually turns 
                itself into a chore, like playing music. Sometimes even simple pleasures like video games and 
                spending time with friends can be come frustrating and mundane, and even kind of tedious. 
                I have always found that I do things much better when I don't think about what I'm doing or why 
                I am doing it. If it comes naturally and if I'm not being forced into something, I always find 
                ways to enjoy it. I guess that's what they describe as 'flow', 
                where I'm so immersed in a task so much that I don't think about the whats or whys. That's the one 
                way that I found myself getting things done in my day to day tasks, like at my old jobs or at 
                school.

                From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
                what are your core values and what do you stand for?<br>
                My core values for myself are just four things that I try to think about each day. Use basic human 
                kindness every day, be treated as you would want to be treated, show respect to yourself and others, and 
                think before you speak. I do try to live by those each day, and when I catch myself slipping I try 
                to put myself back on track and think of how I could have handled those situations differently.<br>
                I don't know if I stood for anything. If a time came where there was a cause that represents 
                what I believed in, then I guess I would stand for that and support it. At this present time, though, 
                I'm feeling pretty lacklustre and probably wouldn't even get out of my chair.

                How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?<br>
                It was good. Reading it out loud made a lot of sense, and I can absolutely see how getting absorbed 
                into those thoughts can be really healing and helpful.

                Any other musings?<br>
                Not particularly though. Still coming down from the aftermath of 7.1 and 7.2.
