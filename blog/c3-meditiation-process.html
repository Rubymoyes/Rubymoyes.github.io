          <h4>Chapter 2 - Mindfulness without Butt on Cushion</h4>

              <h5> How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
              It basically changed my entire process. For me personally, everything is outcome driven, and if something isn't done to my standard or isn't done in a period of time that I am happy with, then I tend to pit my own work up against others to try and get myself into a competitive zone, which I usually assume makes me work harder. That's not the case, though, and most times I just get more and more angry with what I can't achieve. I've just focused on making smaller goals and giving myself more time to achieve them, and I've been pretty decently happy with my outcomes so far this sprint.

              <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
              I more or less considered meditation to be some sort of magical event which happens when you enter a certain state of mind that you can only achieve by absolute focus on yourself, your breathing or someone guiding you through it. That's definitely not what I think of it now.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
              I have learned that I practice walking meditation almost daily. Even when I was working in my full time role, I spent about an hour or more each day walking, and each of those mornings and evenings I would listen to something in my ears and just walk home. Since the path home is memorised, sometimes I would find myself at home and not even remember walking there, that's how out of it I was. I am still yet to put that into practice for the rest of the meditation techniques though. I can go in and out of it when I'm walking because walking is so easy, but sitting still is something I am still having trouble with.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
              Definitely the mindful listening and mindful conversation techniques. I am yet to find someone to try that with, but hopefully someone in my phase 0 group will be willing to try it with me!
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                This chapter was really cool, and I actually found myself reading some parts out loud to myself, which was really relaxing. I have a really soft speaking voice and I studied in radio so I'm pretty decent at reading off of a page, so I recorded myself reading through some of the guided meditation monologue. I will probably listen to them again at some point, maybe when I'm out walking or when I'm going to sleep.
