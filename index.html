            Gah! Can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here. Trying to offset this para using <code>div class="offset-by-eight.column"</code>. I'm just using the <code>div=class four columns</code> (3rd of 3 columns) rule. Should I be trying another rule to make it offset, or can I just use this as a cop-out? :)

          <p>This is where I will be posting all of my online content during <code>Phase 0</code>, and also where I will be linking to my blogs and other related projects. This is definitely still a work in process, I am still working through the kinks, I am definitely on my way to redesigning my website in the way that I want to, and I will be adding some cool stuff when I find some cool resources later on. Thank you for your patience!</p>
