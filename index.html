          <p>This is where I will be posting all of my online content during <code>Phase 0</code>, and also where I will be linking to my blogs and other related projects. This is definitely still a work in process, I am still working through the kinks, I am definitely on my way to redesigning my website in the way that I want to, and I will be adding some cool stuff when I find some cool resources later on. Thank you for your patience!</p>
